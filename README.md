# JakDojade
This C++ program simulates a simplified route-finding system between cities on a map, similar to how a navigation or transit app (like JakDojadę) might work.  It reads a map, identifies cities and roads, and then uses graph algorithms specifically BFS and Dijkstra’s algorithm  to find the shortest travel paths between cities.
